1. Register and Enable Red Hat Subscription
After minimal RHEL 7 installation, it’s time to register and enable your system to Red Hat Subscription repositories and perform a full system update. This is valid only if you have a valid RedHat Subscription. You need to register your in order to enable official RedHat System repositories and update the OS from time-to-time.
We have already covered a detailed instructions on how to register and active RedHat subscription at the below guide.
1.	Register and Enable Red Hat Subscription Repositories in RHEL 7
Note: This step is only for RedHat Enterprise Linux having a valid subscription. If you are running a CentOS server immediately move to further steps.
2. Configure Network with Static IP Address
The first thing you need to do is to configure Static IP address, Route and DNS to your CentOS Server. We will be using ip command the replacement of ifconfig command. However, ifconfig command is still available for most of the Linux distributions and can be installed from default repository.
# yum install net-tools             [Provides ifconfig utility]
 
But as I said we will be using ip command to configure static IP address. So, make sure you first check the current IP address.
# ip addr show
 
Now open and edit file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3 using your choice of editor. Here, I’m using Vi editor and make sure you must be root user to make changes…
# vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
Now we will be editing four fields in the file. Note the below four fields and leave everything else untouched. Also leave double quotes as it is and enter your data in between.
IPADDR = “[Enter your static IP here]” 
GATEWAY = “[Enter your Default Gateway]”
DNS1 = “[Your Domain Name System 1]”
DNS2 = “[Your Domain Name System 2]”
After making the changes ‘ifcfg-enp0s3‘, looks something like the image below. Notice your IP, GATEWAY and DNS will vary, please confirm it with your ISP. Save and Exit.
 
Network Details
Restart service network and check the IP is correct or not, that was assigned. If everything is ok, Ping to see network status…
# service network restart
 
Restart Network Service
After restarting network, make sure to check the IP address and network status…
# ip addr show
# ping -c4 google.com
 
Verify IP Address
 
Check Network Status
3. Set Hostname of Server
The next thing to do is to change the HOSTNAME of the CentOS sever. Check the currently assignedHOSTNAME.
# echo $HOSTNAME
 
Check System Hostname
To set new HOSTNAME we need to edit ‘/etc/hostsname‘ and replace old hostname with the desired one.
# vi /etc/hostname
 
Set System Hostname
After setting hostname, make sure to confirm hostname by logout and login again. After login check new hostname.
$ echo $HOSTNAME
 
Confirm New Hostname
Alternatively you may use command ‘hostname‘ command to view your current hotsname.
$ hostname
4. Update or Upgrade CentOS Minimal Install
This will not install any new packages other than updating and installing the latest version of installed packages and security updates. Moreover Update and Upgrade are pretty same except the fact that Upgrade = Update + enable obsoletes processing during updates.
# yum update && yum upgrade
 
Update Minimal CentOS Server
Important: You can also run the below command which will not prompt for the packages update and you do not need to type ‘y‘ for accepting the changes.
However it is always a good idea to review the changes which is going to take place on the sever specially in production. Hence using the below command may automate the update and upgrade for you but it is not recommended.
# yum -y update && yum -y upgrade
5. Install Command Line Web Browser
In most cases, specially in production environment, we usually install CentOS as command line with no GUI, in this situation we must have a commandline browsing tool to check websites via terminal. For this, we going to install a most famous tool called ‘links‘.
# yum install links
 
Links: Commandline Web Browsing
For usage and examples to browse web sites u links tool, read our article Command Line Web Browsing with Links Tool
6. Install Apache HTTP Server
No matter for what purpose you will be using the server, in most of the cases you need a HTTP server to run websites, multimedia, client side script and many other things.
# yum install httpd
 
Install Apache Server
If you would like to change default port (80) of Apache HTTP Server to any other port. You need to edit the configuration file ‘/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf‘ and search for the line that starts typically like:
LISTEN 80 
Change port number ‘80‘ to any other port (say 3221), save and exit.
 
Change Apache Port
Add the port you just opened for Apache through firewall and then reload firewall.
Allow service http through firewall (Permanent).
# firewall-cmd --add-service=http
Allow port 3221 through firewall (Permanent).
# firewall-cmd -permanent -add-port=3221/tcp
Reload firewall.
# firewall-cmd --reload
After making all above things, now it’s time to restart Apache HTTP server, so that the new port number is taken into effect.
# systemctl restart httpd.service
Now add the Apache service to system-wide to start automatically when system boots.
# systemctl start httpd.service
# systemctl enable httpd.service
Now verify the Apache HTTP Server by using links command line tool as shown in the below screen.
# links 127.0.0.1
 
Verify Apache Status

7. Install PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language for web based services. It is frequently used as general-purpose programming language as well. Install PHP on CentOS Minimal Server as.
# yum install php
After installing php, make sure to restart Apache service to render PHP in Web Browser.
# systemctl restart httpd.service
Next, verify PHP by creating following php script in the Apache document root directory.
# echo -e "<?php\nphpinfo();\n?>"  > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
Now view the PHP file, we just created (phpinfo.php) in Linux Command Line as below.
# php /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
OR
# links http://127.0.0.1/phpinfo.php
 
Verify PHP
8. Install MariaDB Database
MariaDB is a fork of MySQL. RedHat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives have shifted to MariaDB from MySQL. It is the Primary Database management System. It is again one of those tools which is necessary to have and you will need it sooner or later no matter what kind of server you are setting. Install MariaDB on CentOS Minimal Install server as below.
# yum install mariadb-server mariadb
 
Install MariaDB Database
Start and configure MariaDB to start automatically at boot.
# systemctl start mariadb.service
# systemctl enable mariadb.service
Allow service mysql (mariadb) through firewall.
# firewall-cmd --add-service=mysql
Now it’s time to secure MariaDB server.
# /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
 
Secure MariaDB Database

9. Install and Configure SSH Server
SSH stands for Secure Shell which is the default protocol in Linux for remote management. SSH is one of those essential piece of software which comes default with CentOS Minimal Server.
Check Currently Installed SSH version.
# SSH -V
 
Check SSH Version
Use Secure Protocol over the default SSH Protocol and change port number also for extra Security. Edit the SSH configuration file ‘/etc/ssh/ssh_config‘.
Uncomment the line below line or delete 1 from the Protocol string, so the line seems like:
# Protocol 2,1 (Original)
Protocol 2 (Now)
This change force SSH to use Protocol 2 which is considered to be more secure than Protocol 1 and also make sure to change the port number 22 to any in the configuration.
 
Secure SSH Login
Disable SSH ‘root login‘ and allow to connect to root only after login to normal user account for added additional Security. For this, open and edit configuration file ‘/etc/ssh/sshd_config‘ and change PermitRootLogin yes tPermitRootLogin no.
# PermitRootLogin yes (Original) 
PermitRootLogin no (Now)
 
Disable SSH Root Login
Finally, restart SSH service to reflect new changes..
# systemctl restart sshd.service

Check Java Version
12. Install Apache Tomcat
Tomcat is a servlet container designed by Apache to run Java HTTP web server. Install tomcat as below but it is necessary to point out that you must have installed Java prior of installing tomcat.
# yum install tomcat
 
Install Apache Tomcat
After tomcat has been installed, star the tomcat service.
# systemctl start tomcat
Check Version of tomcat.
# /usr/sbin/tomcat version
 
Check Tomcat Version
Add service tomcat and default port (8080) through firewall and reload settings.
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permannet
# firewall-cmd --reload
Now it’s time to secure tomcat server, create a user and a password to access and manage. We need to edit file ‘/etc/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml‘. See the section which looks like:
<tomcat-users>
....
</tomcat-users>


<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
 <role rolename="manager-script"/>
 <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
 <role rolename="manager-status"/>
 <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
 <role rolename="admin-script"/>
 <user username="tecmint" password="tecmint" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
</tomcat-users>
 
Secure Tomcat
Here we added user “tecmint” to administer/manage tomcat using password “tecmint”. Stop and start the service tomcat so that the changes are taken into effect and enable tomcat service to start at system boot.
# systemctl stop tomcat
# systemctl start tomcat
# systemctl enable tomcat.service

14. FirewallD Configuration
firewalld is a firewall service which manages the server dynamically. Firewalld removed iptables in CentOS 7. Firewalld is installed by default on RedHat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives by default. With iptables every change in order to be taken into effect needs to flush all the old rules and create new rules.
However with firewalld, no flushing and recreating of new rules required and only changes are applied on the fly.
Check if Firewalld is running or not.
# systemctl status firewalld

# rpm -ivh webmin-*.rpm
 
Install Webmin
After webmin installation, you will get a message on terminal to login to your host (http://ip-address:10000) using your root password on port number 10000. If running a headless server you can forward the port and access it on a machine/server that is headed.
18. Enable Third Party Repositories
It is not a good idea to add untrusted repositories specially in production and it may be fatal. However just for example here we will be adding a few community approved trusted repositories to install third party tools and packages.
Add Extra Package for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) Repository.
# yum install epel-release

Add Community Enterprise Linux Repository.
# rpm -Uvh http://www.elrepo.org/elrepo-release-7.0-2.el7.elrepo.noarch.rpm
 
Install Epel Repo
Attention! Extra care is needs to be taken while adding Third Party Repository.










19. Install 7-zip Utility
In the CentOS Minimal Install you don’t get utility like unzip or unrar. We have the option to install each utility as required or an utility that servers for all. 7-zip is such an utility which compress and extract files of all known types.

Edit a few fields and leave other as it is, unless you know what you are doing.
anonymous_enable=NO
local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
You may also change the port number and open vsftpd port through the firewall.
# firewall-cmd --add-port=21/tcp
# firewall-cmd --reload
Next restart vsftpd and enable to start at boot time.
# systemctl restart vsftpd
# systemctl enable vsftpd
22. Install and Configure sudo
sudo which is commonly called as super do as well as suitable user do is a program for UNIX-like operating system to execute a program with the security privileged of another user. Let’s see how to configure sudo…
# visudo
It will open the file /etc/sudoers for editing..
 
sudoers File
Give all the permission (equal to root) to a user (say tecmint), that has already been created.
tecmint   ALL=(ALL)    ALL
Give all the permission (equal to root) to a user (say tecmint), except the permission to reboot and shutdownthe server.
Again open the same file and edit it with the below contents.
cmnd_Alias nopermit = /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/reboot
Then add alias with Logical (!) operator.
tecmint   ALL=(ALL)    ALL,!nopermit
Give permission to a group (say debian) to run a few root privilege command say (add user and delete user) .
cmnd_Alias permit = /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/userdel
And then add the permission to group debian.
debian ALL=(ALL) permit

30. Password Protect GRUB
Password protect your boot loader so that you get an additional level of security right at the booting time. Also you get a protection layer of protection at physical level. Protect your Server by locking GRUB at boot to avoid any unauthorized access.
First make backup of two files, so that if anything goes bad, you have the option to revert back. Create a backup of ‘/etc/grub2/grub.cfg‘ as ‘/etc/grub2/grub.cfg.old‘.
# cp /boot/grub2/grub.cfg /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.old
Also, Create a backup of ‘/etc/grub.d/10_linux‘ as ‘/etc/grub.d/10_linux.old‘.
# cp /etc/grub.d/10_linux /etc/grub.d/10_linux.old
Now open ‘/etc/grub.d/10_linux‘ and add the below line at the end of the file.
cat <<EOF
set superusers=”tecmint”
Password tecmint avi@123
EOF
 
Password Protect Grub
Notice in the above file, replace “tecmint” as username and “avi@123” as password with your username and password.
Now generate the new grub.cfg file by issuing following command.
# grub2-mkconfig --output=/boot/grub2/grub.cfg
 
Generate Grub File
After creating new grub.cfg file, reboot the machine and press ‘e‘ to edit. You will find that it requires you to enter ‘valid credentials‘ in order to edit boot menu.
 
Password Protected Boot Menu
After entering login credentials, you will able to edit grub boot menu.
 
Grub Menu File
Also you can generate encrypted password in place of plain password as shown in the above step. First generate an encrypted password as suggested below.
# grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

[Enter Normal password twice]
 
Generate Encrypted Grub Password
Now open ‘/etc/grub.d/10_linux‘ file and add the below line at the end of the file.
cat <<EOF
set superusers=”tecmint”
Password_pbkdf2 tecmint
grub.pbkdf2.sha512**************************************************
EOF
 
Encrypted Grub Password
Replace the password with the one generated on your system. Don’t forget to cross check the password.
Also note you need to generate grub.cfg in this case as well, as described above. Reboot and next time you press ‘e‘ to edit, you will be prompted for username and password.
We’ve tried to cover most of the necessary post-installation points of industry standard distributions RHEL 7and CentOS 7. If you find that we’ve missed certain points or you need to extend this post with a new post-install things, you may share with us, we will include your point in this article by extending it.
